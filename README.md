This is a web game I made to learn about GO language and full stack structure.

In the game, each user has one move per hour in the game. A move may be attacking or defending a country.

Every day at 14.00 UTC, the country with most attack-defend value gets nuked and destroyed.
The destroyed countries are black and can not be interacted.
When only one country remains, that country wins the game.
